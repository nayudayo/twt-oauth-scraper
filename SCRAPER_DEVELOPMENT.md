## Questions for Discussion:
1. Should we prioritize performance optimizations or anti-detection features?
2. Do we need all metrics (likes, retweets, views) or focus on content first?
3. How important is media extraction compared to text content?
4. What level of error logging and progress tracking would be most useful?
