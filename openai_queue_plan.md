# OpenAI Request Queue and Error Handling Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Chat API (`/api/chat/route.ts`)
- ✅ Using queue for OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Queue integration complete
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Basic error handling with catch blocks
- ✅ Request tracking through queue

### Analyze API (`/api/analyze/route.ts`)
- ✅ Using queue for OpenAI API calls
- ✅ Queue integration complete
- ✅ Rate limiting implemented
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Request tracking through queue

## Implementation Order (Revised)

### Phase 1: Core Queue System (Essential) ✅
1. Basic Queue Manager (`src/lib/queue/openai-queue.ts`) ✅
- [x] Define QueueItem interface with essential fields
- [x] Create OpenAIQueueManager with in-memory queue
- [x] Implement singleton pattern
- [x] Add basic queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- [x] Add concurrent request processing

2. Basic Rate Limiting (`src/lib/queue/rate-limiter.ts`) ✅
- [x] Create simple in-memory RateLimiter
- [x] Add window-based rate limiting
- [x] Implement request counting
- [x] Add basic throttling

3. Essential Error Handling ✅
- [x] Define basic error categories
- [x] Add simple retry mechanism
- [x] Implement basic error recovery
- [x] Add request timeout handling

4. API Integration (Core Features) ✅
- [x] Update chat route with queue
- [x] Update analyze route with queue
- [x] Add basic error responses
- [x] Implement request timeouts

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (After Core is Stable) ⬅ NEXT STEP
1. Advanced Queue Features
- [ ] Add priority queuing
- [ ] Implement fair scheduling
- [ ] Add queue size limits
- [ ] Add request cancellation

2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- [ ] Add per-user rate limits
- [ ] Implement adaptive throttling
- [ ] Add rate limit notifications
- [ ] Add limit bypass for priority requests

3. Advanced Error Handling
- [ ] Add exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting
- [ ] Implement recovery strategies

### Phase 3: Monitoring (Essential Metrics)
1. Basic Monitoring
- [ ] Add queue length tracking
- [ ] Track request success/failure
- [ ] Monitor rate limit hits
- [ ] Add basic logging

### Phase 4: Persistence (Future Enhancement)
1. Database Integration
- [ ] Add queue persistence
- [ ] Store rate limit data
- [ ] Log error history
- [ ] Track usage metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Start with priority queuing implementation
   - Add fair scheduling for concurrent requests
   - Implement queue size limits
   - Add request cancellation support

2. **Testing Required**
   - Test queue behavior with real requests
   - Verify rate limiting works
   - Check error handling and retries
   - Monitor concurrent request handling

3. **Documentation Needed**
   - Document queue configuration
   - Document rate limit settings
   - Add usage examples
   - Document error handling

## Success Criteria (Revised)

### Essential (Phase 1) ✅
- [x] Queue handles concurrent requests properly
