# CONSTRAINTS
- only alter the files that are relevant to the problem, task, and context scope
- build upon the current implementation (meaning to utilize existing implementations and build upon that)
- modify the parts and functions one part at a time so that there will be a reduced risk for errors
- if linter errors arise, fix them first before marking the task as finished
- update the .md plan of the task
