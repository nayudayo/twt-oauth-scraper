CONTENT: 
- summary of what we are going to implement
- explicit steps for the implementation
- the objects to implement in a format specified below

FORMAT:
- checklist style implementation steps
- for each module/part/objects to be implemented, instead of code snippets, we shall be describing the algorithm and logic in a clear mannerr that can be studied and altered like a prompt engineering

REMEMBER:
- focus on the core functionalities first before we go to the advanced optimizations and improvements
