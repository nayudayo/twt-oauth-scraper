 # OAuth Integration Rules

## Overview
- This module handles secure Twitter OAuth authentication for the application.
- It ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.

## Configuration
- Store client ID, client secret, and callback URLs securely using environment variables.
- Use HTTPS for all OAuth-related endpoints to maintain a secure connection.

## Authentication Flow
- Validate OAuth callbacks and tokens thoroughly.
- Implement secure cookie/session management to persist user sessions.
- Support token rotation and expiration as per OAuth best practices.

## Error Handling
- Log errors without exposing sensitive details.
- Return clear and secure error messages during authentication failures.

## Security Guidelines
- Follow Twitter's OAuth policies rigorously.
- Periodically review and update the OAuth integration to align with the latest security standards.

## Testing & Maintenance
- Write unit and integration tests specifically for the OAuth flow.
- Regularly audit the OAuth implementation for potential vulnerabilities.
