 # Chat API Rules

## Overview
- The chat API endpoint must accept only HTTP POST requests.
- All interactions should be conducted through JSON payloads.

## Request Structure
- Required fields: `message` and `analysis`.
- Optional fields: `profile` and `tuning`.
- Ensure incoming data adheres to the defined types.

## Processing Guidelines
- Adjust personality traits based on provided `traitModifiers`.
- Combine personality interests from analysis and custom inputs, then filter and sort based on weight.

## Response Handling
- Return HTTP 400 for missing required fields.
- Return HTTP 500 for internal errors.
- All responses must be in JSON format.

## Logging & Error Handling
- Log errors using `console.error` without exposing sensitive data.
