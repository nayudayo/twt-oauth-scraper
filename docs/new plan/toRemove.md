# Funnel Removal Architecture Plan

## Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation
### Steps:
1. System Audit
   - Identify all funnel-related components
   - Map dependencies and integrations
   - Document neural code touchpoints
   - Create backup of current system

2. Impact Assessment
   - Evaluate affected functionalities
   - List dependent services
   - Identify potential risks
   - Plan fallback strategies

## Phase 2: Neural Code Preservation
### Steps:
1. Code Isolation
   - Separate neural code from funnel logic
   - Create independent neural code modules
   - Document neural code interfaces
   - Setup standalone testing environment

2. Neural Code Enhancement
   - Optimize existing neural algorithms
   - Update neural code documentation
   - Implement improved error handling
   - Add monitoring capabilities

## Phase 3: Funnel Removal Implementation
### Steps:
1. Component Removal
   - Remove funnel UI elements
   - Clean up funnel-specific routes
   - Delete funnel database schemas
   - Remove funnel configuration files

2. System Cleanup
   - Remove funnel dependencies
   - Clean up unused imports
   - Delete funnel-related tests
   - Update build configurations

## Phase 4: System Integration
### Steps:
1. Neural Code Integration
   - Connect preserved neural code
   - Update API endpoints
   - Implement new data flow
   - Setup monitoring systems

2. Testing and Validation
   - Run integration tests
   - Verify neural code functionality
   - Perform load testing
   - Validate data integrity

## Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring
### Steps:
1. Staged Deployment
   - Deploy to development environment
   - Run system-wide tests
   - Deploy to staging
   - Plan production rollout

2. Post-Deployment Tasks
   - Monitor system performance
   - Document changes
   - Update system architecture diagrams
   - Archive removed components
