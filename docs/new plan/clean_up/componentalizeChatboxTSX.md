- Maintain chat interface functionality
- Improve code maintainability
- Enhance component reusability

Expected Impact:
- Improved code organization
- Better maintainability
- Enhanced component isolation
- Reduced component complexity

## Implementation Steps

### Step 3: ChatBox Refactoring
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:
Refactor ChatBox.tsx to use new container components

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Remove panel code
   - Integrate containers
   - Update interfaces
   - Optimize imports

2. Input Requirements:
   - New containers
   - Interface definitions
   - State management
   - Event system

3. Output Expectations:
   - Cleaned ChatBox component
   - Updated interfaces
   - Optimized imports
   - Documentation

4. Validation Points:
   - Functionality preservation
   - Performance impact
   - Code cleanliness
   - Type safety

Dependencies:
- New containers
- TypeScript compiler
- Testing framework

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] ChatBox refactored
