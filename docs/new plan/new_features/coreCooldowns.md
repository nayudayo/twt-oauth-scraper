# Core Cooldowns Implementation Plan

## Summary
Implementation of a unified 1-hour cooldown system for both analysis and scraping modules to standardize rate limiting and resource management across the application.

Core Objectives:
- Implement consistent 1-hour cooldowns for analysis module
- Implement consistent 1-hour cooldowns for scraping module
- Create unified cooldown management system

Expected Impact:
- Improved resource utilization
- Standardized rate limiting
- Better user experience with predictable wait times

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Cooldown System Design
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:
Design and implement core cooldown management system

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Design cooldown tracking mechanism
   - Create cooldown enforcement system
   - Implement cooldown reset logic

2. Input Requirements:
   - Module identifier (analysis/scraping)
   - Last execution timestamp
   - Cooldown duration (1 hour)

3. Output Expectations:
   - Cooldown status (active/inactive)
   - Time remaining until cooldown expires
   - Next available execution time

4. Validation Points:
   - Cooldown duration accuracy
   - Timestamp handling
   - Edge case handling

Dependencies:
- Existing timing system
- Module execution tracking

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Cooldown tracking system implemented
- [ ] Duration calculations verified
- [ ] Edge cases handled

### Step 2: Analysis Module Integration
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Implement cooldown checks
   - Add cooldown enforcement
   - Update user feedback system

2. Input Requirements:
   - Analysis module execution requests
   - User session data
   - Current cooldown status

3. Output Expectations:
   - Execution permission status
   - Time remaining feedback
   - User notifications

4. Validation Points:
   - Cooldown enforcement accuracy
   - User feedback clarity
   - System performance impact

Dependencies:
- Core cooldown system
- Analysis module access points

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Cooldown checks implemented

### Step 3: Scraping Module Integration
Status: [ ] Not Started

Description:
Integrate cooldown system with scraping module

Specifications:
1. Core Operations:
   - Implement cooldown checks
   - Add cooldown enforcement
   - Update user feedback system

2. Input Requirements:
   - Scraping module execution requests
   - User session data
   - Current cooldown status

3. Output Expectations:
   - Execution permission status
   - Time remaining feedback
   - User notifications

4. Validation Points:
   - Cooldown enforcement accuracy
   - User feedback clarity
   - System performance impact

Dependencies:
- Core cooldown system
- Scraping module access points

Completion Criteria:
- [ ] Cooldown checks implemented
- [ ] User feedback system updated
- [ ] Integration tests passed

## Module Specifications

### Cooldown Manager
Purpose: Manage and enforce cooldown periods across modules

Algorithm:
1. Core Logic:
   - Track module execution timestamps
   - Calculate cooldown status
   - Enforce cooldown periods
   
2. Dependencies:
   - Time management system
   - User session system
   
3. Constraints:
   - 1-hour fixed cooldown period
   - Must handle timezone differences
   
4. Integration Points:
   - Analysis module interface
   - Scraping module interface

## Success Criteria
- Cooldown Duration: Exactly 1 hour for both modules
- System Response: < 100ms for cooldown checks
- Error Rate: < 0.1% in cooldown enforcement
- User Satisfaction: Clear feedback on cooldown status

## Implementation Order
1. Core cooldown management system
2. Analysis module integration
3. Scraping module integration
4. User feedback system
5. System-wide testing

## Notes
- Consider implementing a grace period for edge cases
- Plan for future cooldown period adjustments
- Monitor system performance impact
- Consider user feedback for improvements
